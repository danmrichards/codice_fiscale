CODICE FISCALE
--------------
This module provides a field type for the Italian tax code - Codice
Fiscale. This field type can be used on any Drupal entity and the module
provides its own validation logic for data entered in the field(s).

REQUIREMENTS
------------
This module requires only the core field module.

INSTALLATION
------------
  * Enable the Codice Fiscale module.
  * Clear cache.
  * Add the field to an entity/content type as you normally would.

ROADMAP
------
The module is very basic at this point. Future plans are:

  * Refactor validation logic to be more OO and re-usable.
  * Unit tests.
  * Implement advanced validation of the codice fiscale number based on user
    information (date of birth, name, place of birth).
  * Generation of codice fiscale based on user information.
  * Leverage PHP community libraries for advanced validation and generation.
